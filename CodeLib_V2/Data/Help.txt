CodeLib V2.0 - HELPFILES

The database is a sequential file, stored in the Data-directory.
I used a sequential file, because I hate Random-Acces files. It must be said.

With this program, you can have a personal database with code snippets,
helpfiles and notes. Once you added a code-snippet, you can add a helpfile,
either by loading it, or by writing it yourself.
Notes must be written, and they will be part of the database until you clear
them. This way, you can addapt the CodeLib to your own needs.

I've made place for a 1000 entries, and 100 categories.
These are fixed values in the program. The whole program is based on this,
so if you don't have enough, changing the dimensions will not be sufficient.

1) *** The toolbar ***
The toolbar has 11 buttons, wich will be discussed here

 1.1 Save Database
 With this button, you can save the database. You can only save the
 database when it's dirty, but that is marked on the screen. This button is a
 safety, because the file will be saved - if dirty - when you leave the CodeLib.
 But it's never wrong to save your work once and a while.

 1.2 Print Code/Helpfile
 You can print 2 different things:
   1) When the Code-tab is selected, it will print out the code.
   2) If the Help-tab is selected, it will print out the helpfile.
 Notes cannot be printed.

 1.3 Copy Code
 This button puts the code in the ClipBoard. There's no need to select the
 Code-tab.
 This way it's easy to add a routine to your VB-project:
   1) Start the CodeLib V2.0
   2) Look for the code you want to add to your program, and hit this button.
   3) Go back to your VB-project
   4) Paste the code where you want to have it. Ctrl/V works !
 A label is always telling you what code is in the clipboard.
Important Note:
When you copy something else (CTRL/C), let say in the help-tab, the
Clipboard will be filled with other data, but the label will still say what
code is in the Clipboard. So be carefull with this.
I used the Clipboard to store the code, because it's easy, and you can
switch between different programs like that.

 1.4 Kill Code
 This button kills the selected code, helpfile and notes.
 Be carefull: there's no UNDO-command, so once removed, it will be
 lost forever.

 1.5 Rename Code
 The selected code will be renamed. A special Rename-window pops up.
 If the new name exists in the database, you will be notified, and asked
 to rename again. Upper and lower case is not important. If you rename the
 code as 'test' and 'TEST' (or 'TeSt') already exists, it will not be accepted.

 1.6 Move Code
 This button moves the selected code to another category.

 1.7 Category
 With this button, you can add a new category to the CodeLib.
 If the new category already exists, you will be notified. Again, upper or
 lowercase is not important.

 1.8 Rename Category
 The selected category can be renamed. 
 If the renamed category already exists, you will be notified. Again, upper
 or lowercase is not important.

 1.9 Kill Category.
 This button removes the selected category from the CodeLib.
 IMPORTANT: you can only remove empty categories. If the selected 
 category contains code-data, it can not be removed.

 1.10 Search Code/Helpfiles.
 A new screen pops up. Here you can browse your drive(s) to search for
 code or helpfiles. Once found, you must select the text (or part of it) to
 add to the CodeLib. A button is provided to select all the text.
 If you found code, press the 'copy as code'-button. In a new window,
 you will be asked to name it and give it a category. You can only add to
 an existing category ! If you found code that belongs in another category,
 you must create that category first !
 You can also replace code here. The files will be searched, and if that
 name already exists, you will be notified. If you want to replace the code,
 press 'Yes', else press 'No' and give the code another name.
 If you found a help-file, press the 'copy as help'-button.
 A new window pops up where you can select the name of the code.
 The text will be added in the Help-section of that code.
 If there's already a helpfile, you will be notified. If you press 'Yes', the
 helpfile will be overwritten.

 1.11 Help
 You are now reading it...


2) *** The Category-Combo ***
Here you can select the category you wish to view.


3) *** The Name-List ***
This list shows all the names of code in the selected category.
Click on a name to view the code, help or notes.


4) *** The Tab ***
 In the tab you have 4 sections, wich will be discussed here.
 1.1 Code
 When this tab is selected, you can view the code. You can't do anything
 here. This is just a textfile to view the selected code.  You are notified here
 if this code contains help or notes.

 1.2 Help
 Here you can view/edit the helpfile attached to the selected code, also
 print out the helpfile.
 NOTE: when this tab loses the focus, it will be part of the CodeLib.
 There's no warning, except for a little black box, telling you the help
 is dirty.

 1.3 Notes
 Here you can view/edit the notes attached to the selected code.
 NOTE: when this tab loses the focus, it will be part of the CodeLib.
 There's no warning, except for a little black box, telling you the notes
 are dirty.

 1.4 Edit Code
 This tab shows the selected code, but here you can edit. After editing,
 you will be asked if this text should replace the selected code.
 Note that there's no way to test it, so be sure before you replace !
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES

1) A black box and a label are telling you when the CodeLib is dirty.
  Save after you worked a bit !

2) When you leave the CodeLib, and the data is dirty, it will be saved, so
  you don't have to save before you leave.

3) Be sure to store the folder named 'Data' in de same directory of the
  Codelib, because i'm using App.Path to acces this datafile.

4) A right-click in the code-window shows a popup-menu, with the
  commands:
   * Copy
   * Kill Code
   * Rename Code
   * Move Code

5) This program was written in VB6-Enterprise Edition.
  I did a great deal of thinking before I began coding this.
  Even in the development of this program, I had some ideas
  that could improve the whole thing. I tested the program over and
  over again, did some extreme things, just to see how it would behave.
  But one can never be sure... If you find bugs, or things that can be
  improved, please let me know:

  stephan.swertvaegher@planetinternet.be
  or... Click on 'SendMail' above in the right corner.

  Now it has a place in my collection of favorites, like VB4 and VB6,
  Word, Excell, Acces, Paint Shop Pro 6, IconAlbumDeluxe, etc...
  Hope it will be there in your favorites too...

A final thing. Because you can never be sure, now and then I
make a copy of the file CodeLib.cod. If something goes wrong,
and I hope not, you still have a copy of the files.
